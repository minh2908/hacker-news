    "# What Insight Can You Get From a Social News Website? An Analysis on Hacker News\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News is a popular social news website founded by Y Combinator - a well-known startup accelerator in the US. The site mainly focuses on computer science and entrepreneurship. Users can submit content to Hacker News which can be voted and commented upon by members in the community. In this project, we look at the data about 20,000 threats submitted on Hacker News. We are especially interested in two kinds of posts: `Ask HN` and `Show HN`. `Ask HN` is the type of posts when a member wants to ask the community something, for example, `How to create a good data science project?`; and `Show HN` is the type of posts when a member wants to show the community something interesting, e.g., `CatDrone: a drone that follows your cat`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze the data of Hacker News to answer the following two questions: \n",
    "* Which kind of posts receives more comments on average?\n",
    "* Does time of posting affect the number of comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Extraction\n",
